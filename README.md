# Odin Project Foundations

This is my attempt at the given assignment for the Project of replicating a Google Homepage.


## My process

- Solution URL: [Solution URL here](https://github.com/livlivana/google-homepage)
- Live Site URL: [Live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

I started off by first deciding the structure of the HTML: how many different segments should I have. Second, I filled in the skeleton structure with the components such as the buttons, links and lists. Next, I added in the relevant images and links.

Then, I begin working and styling the page section by section.
Throughout the process, I utilized the Firefox Developer Tool and used it as a guide and reference.
